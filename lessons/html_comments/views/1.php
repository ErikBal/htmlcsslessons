        <p>Comments are a great asset to new developers and a great way to place little notes to yourself reminding yourself what pieces of code are doing what. 
        Comments are also great ways to troubleshoot bugs and code errors, as they give you the ability to comment out lines of code one at a time to search for the 
        exact line causing problems.</p>
