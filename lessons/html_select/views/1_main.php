        <p>A <?php $t->cHTML('<select>'); ?> tag will allow your users to choose an option from a list without having to show all of the available options at once.  Imagine 
        how much space it would take up to display all 50 states at once on a shipping form.  A SELECT FIELD can help with that.  Incorporating a select field into a web page is done 
        using the <?php $t->cHTML('<select>'); ?> tag. List values are then added to the field using the <?php $t->cHTML('<option>'); ?> tag, similar to how list 
        items <?php $t->cHTML('<li>'); ?> are added to ordered list elements (<?php $t->cHTML('<ol>'); ?>).</p>
